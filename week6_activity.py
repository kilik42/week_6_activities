# Problem Set on Python Lists
# Creation and Basic Operations:
# Create a list containing the names of five of your favorite movies.
# Add another movie to the end of the list.
# Insert a movie at the third position in the list.
# Remove the last movie from the list. What movie was it?
# How would you check if "The Matrix" is in your list of favorite movies?
# Indexing and Slicing:
# Given the list nums = [5, 11, 15, 7, 3, 9]:
# What is the second element?
# What are the last three elements?
# What are the first four elements?
# Using slicing, how can you get a reversed version of the list?
# List Manipulation:
# Sort the nums list in descending order.
# What's the index of number 15 in the sorted list?
# How many times does number 7 appear in the list?
# Remove the first occurrence of number 3 from the list.
# Iteration and Comprehensions:
# Print each number from the nums list multiplied by 2.
# Using list comprehension, create a new list containing only the odd numbers from the nums list.
# Nested Lists:
# Given the matrix matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]:
# How would you access the number 5?
# Replace the number 6 with 10.
# Print all numbers from the last row.
# Challenges:
# Using list comprehension, generate a list of squares of the numbers from 1 to 10.
# Given a list of words ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"], use list comprehension to create a list containing the lengths of each word.
# Implement a function flatten(nested_list) that takes in a nested list and returns a flat (1D) version of it.
